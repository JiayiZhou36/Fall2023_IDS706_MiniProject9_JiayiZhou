* [Example notebook here](https://github.com/nogibjj/hosted-notebooks-lab/blob/main/Chapter7_data_science.ipynb)

**Action Items:**

- Import a sample dataset into the cloud notebook (Ingest stage)

- Perform basic data inspection such as checking the number of rows and columns, data types, summary statistics etc (EDA stage) 

- Filter the data based on specific criteria and create a new filtered dataset (EDA)

- Group the data by one or more columns and aggregate metrics like mean, max etc (EDA)

- Join the main dataset with another supplementary dataset (EDA) 

- Create various data visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, box plots etc (EDA)


**Challenge Items:**

- Identify and handle missing or erroneous data in the dataset (EDA) 

- Perform advanced data transformations like normalization, binning, log transforms etc (EDA)

- Implement interactive visualizations and sliders using libraries like plotly (EDA)

- Train a simple machine learning model on the data like linear regression, random forest etc (Modeling stage)

- Evaluate the trained model performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrix etc (Modeling)

- Summarize key data insights, visualizations and models in a report (Conclusion stage)
